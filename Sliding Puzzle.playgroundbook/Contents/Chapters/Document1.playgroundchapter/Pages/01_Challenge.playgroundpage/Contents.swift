In this playground, youâ€™ll configure your own sliding puzzle and learn how to let the computer help you in solving them.
 
**Goal:** Arrange the pieces in the right order, so that a complete picture shows up.
 
Run the code below in order to practice the game mechanics with an easy puzzle at the beginning. You can click on a single piece in the puzzle to move it.
